hi there, my dear fellow developers i am very much glad to be a part of this GOOGLE SOLUTION CHALLENGE event.
my solution includes a advertisement free android browser ecspecially made for students below 18 and kids, it contains many safety features such as parental controls and real time monitoring by their parents and it contains some advanced blockers to block adult 18+ websites.these kids take their online classes without any disturbance.
